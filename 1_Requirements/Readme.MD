## Introduction:

* Here we are proposing utility software for Personal Diary. This software will help people to keep their personal informations like daily notes, photos etc, safe for a long period of time . The present system is manual and we are attempting to design a software which will make it more efficient. It is designed to overcome the problems that we face with the conventional diary.

## Research:

* Personal Diary is a multi-user environment to deal with the administration of Diary writing. The system includes modules for create user, registration, diary writing, reminder setting, photo gallery, calculator, user accounts and autobiography etc.
In this console application, you can add, view, edit and delete records. Records can be added with many information such as duration of task, name, address, time and date. File handling has been effectively used to keep the records.

## Features:

* This software can be used by different persons by using different user names and passwords. The person who has an account (administrators) can add daily notes, add photos, set reminders, write autobiography, add biodata etc. There is an advantage of classifying the photos which the administrator adds as private and public. By adding the photos as private the administrator who added the photo will only have the right to delete and the photos will be visible only to the administrator.

## Swot analysis:
## Strengths:
* User friendly interface
* Used by any age group
* Saves paper work

## Weakness:
* No use if people do not check diaries regularly

## Threats:
* Data Security
* Create dependence on technology
* Risk of creating non critical thinkers
